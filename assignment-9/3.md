How to pass data from one component to another component?


Data can be passed from one component to another in React using props, context, or by lifting state up.

Props (short for "properties") are inputs passed to React components to provide data and configuration.

Context is a feature in React that allows data to be passed down the component tree without explicit prop passing.

Lifting state refers to moving state management to a higher-level component in React.
