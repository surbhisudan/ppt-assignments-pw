Q.5 Difference between class & function based component

Ans: Class Component:

Defined as ES6 classes. Supports state and lifecycle methods. More verbose syntax. Can have performance optimizations. Historical approach, used in older React versions.

Functional Component:

Defined as JavaScript functions. Does not support state or lifecycle methods. Less verbose syntax. Lightweight and performant. Modern approach, recommended in newer React versions.
