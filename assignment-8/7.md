
Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it.

Ans: Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing props through multiple intermediate components to reach a deeply nested child component that actually needs the data. It can lead to code complexity and maintenance issues.

Ways to avoid it:

Use React Context API for global state sharing. Implement Redux for centralized state management. Utilize React's useContext hook for easy prop access. Apply component composition to minimize prop drilling. Employ higher-order components (HOCs) to inject necessary props.
